# data_analysis_2022
My data analysis H/W and final project (made during hse 2022 course)

## Final Report

The main goal of this project is to predict as accurately as possible the price of mobile devices based on their characteristics, i.e., to build the best machine learning model. 

The structure of the report is following:

1. Problem Statement
2. EDA (including the step of selecting variables)
3. Regression Analysis
4. Machine Learning Models (linear regression, decision trees, ensembles)
5. Model selection and final conclusion

## Conclusion

I've built 1 regression model, 2 trees models, 2 ensembles (adaboost, bagging). I've made comparison using R2 score (both test and train sets), RMSE and SD from cross-validation of models. The Linear Regression Model did best at predicting the price of a mobile device.
